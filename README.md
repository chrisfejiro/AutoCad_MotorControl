# AutoCAD Electrical ‚Äì 3-Phase Electric Motor Circuit Diagram Project

This project is part of the AutoCAD Electrical course, in which you will design a full circuit diagram for a **3-phase electric motor**. You‚Äôll learn both the theoretical and practical aspects of drafting, wiring, and preparing schematics in a professional standard.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

- Create a detailed, properly annotated circuit diagram for a 3-phase electric motor using **AutoCAD Electrical**.
- Understand motor wiring, loads, control components, and protection devices such as contactors, overload relays, and fuses.
- Apply standards and best practices for schematic layout, component tagging, and annotations.

---

## üìã What You Will Learn

- Basics of 3-phase motor wiring (star / delta / direct online starter etc.).
- Drawing power circuits and control circuits.
- Adding motor protection and safety components.
- Using AutoCAD Electrical features: schematic components, wire numbering, panel layout, cross referencing.
- Labeling, legends, and documentation for proper clarity.

---

## üõ† Project Requirements

### Software

- **AutoCAD Electrical** (version compatible with course / lab requirements).

### Hardware / Reference

- Specs for the 3-phase motor (voltage, current rating, phase configuration).
- Datasheets for components (contactors, overload relay, fuses, switches, etc.).

## üîå Suggested Circuit Components & Layout

While exact components may vary, a typical motor circuit diagram will include:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| 3-phase motor | The main load being controlled. |
| Contactor | To switch the motor ON/OFF. |
| Overload relay | Motor protection against overcurrent. |
| Fuses / Circuit breaker | Protection against short circuits. |
| Start/Stop push buttons | Control inputs. |
| Motor starter control logic (if required) | Direct online, star-delta, etc. |
| Power supply / control supply (e.g. 24VDC, 110V, etc.)| For control circuit. |
| Auxiliary contacts | For feedback and interlocks. |

## üìù Project Steps

1. Define motor specification: voltage (e.g. 415V), current, power rating, phase type.  
2. Determine whether you use a **direct online (DOL)** starter, **star-delta**, or other method.  
3. Draft the **power circuit**: incoming supply, fuses / breaker, contactor, motor connections.  
4. Draft the **control circuit**: start/stop buttons, coils, auxiliary contacts, wiring.  
5. Insert protection devices: overloads, thermal protectors etc.  
6. Annotate: wire numbers, component tags, ratings, lead numbers.  
7. Check layout: ensure clarity, minimal crossings, logical flow from left to right, top to bottom.  
8. Generate legend / parts list if required.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- Complete schematic diagram (power + control) of the motor circuit.  
- Proper annotations: component tags, wire numbers, voltage ratings.  
- Bill of Materials (if requested).  
- PDF / DWG output of your schematic.

---

## ‚è± Time & Grading

- **Estimated time**: XX hours (as per course schedule).  
- **Evaluation criteria**: clarity of diagram, correctness of circuit logic, adherence to electrical standards, neatness, component selection.

## üîÆ Tips & Best Practices

- Keep wire routes clean: avoid unnecessary cross-overs.  
- Use consistent symbol library (standard symbols for motor, contactor, overload).  
- When in doubt, consult standards (IEC, IEEE) or course guidelines.  
- Review examples of motor diagrams for reference.  
- Validate your circuit logic (e.g. pressing stop, emergency stop, etc.).
